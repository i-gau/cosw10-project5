            <div class="column">
            <p>
                The beautiful city of Venice is located on northeastern coast of Italy in the Veneto region. It's built on 118 small islands in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Lagoon" target="_blank">Venetian Lagoon</a>
                with over 400 bridges. Venice is known by many names; "The Floating City", "City of Canals", "City of Mask", and "Queen of the Adriatic" to name a few. The city is surrounded by beautiful architecture, famous artwork, and hundreds of winding canals.
                Venice is one of the most popular tourist destinations and a center of culture. Unsuprisingly Venice's cuisine is primarly seafood based. Some well known dishes of the region the try are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Risotto al nero di seppia (Cuttlefish ink risotto)</li>
                    <li>Bigoli in salsa (Pasta in anchovy sauce)</li>
                    <li>Sarde in saor (Sardines preserved in sweet and sour marinade)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>There are vast amounts of things to do. See links to right for more information.</p><br>
            <p>RIALTO BRIDGE - One of the oldest bridges over the Grand Canal. First built of wood then rebuilt of stone in 1588 and completed in 1591. A very famous tourist landmark.</p><br>
            <p>BASILICA DI SAN MARCO - An ornate Roman Catholic Cathedral with very intricate architecture. I'm not religious but the history and sights are worth a stop.</p><br>
            <p>ST. MARCO'S SQUARE - Located right outside of the Basilica di San Marco is this large open square with many events, entertainers, and vendors scattered all around. Very fun to wander around and take in the culture.</p><br>
            <p>GONDOLA RIDES - It's a wonderful experience drifting around the canals, seeing the colorful boats and buildings. Also a romantic experience with a significant other.</p><br>
